# TerrainTools
Desc:

**Server-Side Info**: This mod does work as a client-side only mod and only needs to be installed on the server if you wish to enforce configuration settings.

## Instructions
If you are using a mod manager for Thunderstore simply install the mod from there. If you are not using a mod manager then, you need a modded instance of Valheim (BepInEx) and the Jotunn plugin installed.

## Configuration
Changes made to the configuration settings will be reflected in-game immediately (no restart required) and they will also sync to clients if the mod is on the server. The mod also has a built in file watcher so you can edit settings via an in-game configuration manager (changes applied upon closing the in-game configuration manager) or by changing values in the file via a text editor or mod manager.

### Global Section Configuration:

**Verbosity**
- Low will log basic information about the mod. Medium will log information that is useful for troubleshooting. High will log a lot of information, do not set it to this without good reason as it will slow down your game.
  - Acceptable values: Low, Medium, High
  - Default value: Low.

## Known Issues
None so far, tell me if you find any.

## Planned Improvements
- Add a shovel that lets you lower terrain.

## Compatibility
Should be fully compatible with everything except some of the other mods that change how the Hoe works.

## Donations/Tips
My mods will always be free to use but if you feel like saying thanks you can tip/donate.

### Contributions
If you would like to provide suggestions, make feature requests, or reports bugs and compatibility issues you can either open an issue on the Github repository or tag me (@searica) with a message on my discord [Searica's Mods](https://discord.gg/sFmGTBYN6n).

I'm a grad student and have a lot of personal responsibilities on top of that so I can't promise I will respond quickly, but I do intend to maintain and improve the mod in my free time.

### Credits
This mod was inspired by and is based on OCDHeim by javadevils as well as HoeRadius by aedenthorn.
